          Hello! My name is Max Mosier, and I'm currently a junior majoring in
          CTD at CU. In my free time, I enjoy playing the piano, creating
          illustrations both traditionally and digitally, 3D rendering,
          programming, and experimenting with various microcontrollers. I'm
          passionate about learning new skills and expanding my knowledge in
          these areas.
        </p>
        <p>
          This site was made as my midterm for the class ATLS 2200, and for most
          of its design process, I was just having fun learning more about how
          to use CSS!
